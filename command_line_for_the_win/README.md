# command_line_for_the_win

## This project has 2 learning points:
1. Commandline commands such as ls, grep, cd etc
2. Secure File Transfer Protocal(sftp) - this is basically the process of transfering files from one place to another(from a client to a server) in a secure way, the files are usually encrypted for security purposes.
	- 	You are supposed to do the commandline challenge, take screenshots and upload the to them sandbox which is acting as the server now, your local machine is the client.
	- I downloaded and used the Filezilla free version for this project.

## Problems encountered:
- I kept getting a timeout error and the client(my machine) refused to connect to the server(the sandbox)
- I solved this by adjusting the default timeout setting in FileZilla from 20seconds to 0  and changed my network settings to a strong one for faster connection.
